# Neverglade
Neverglade is a fork, or maybe more of an expansion, of the beautiful [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) colour scheme for Vim. It collapses the light and dark variants of terminal colours into their bright variants, expands the range of background colours, and adds 8 new colours for use in designing. In addition, it is a project to make as many ports of the scheme as possible.

## Motivation
Everforest is perhaps my favourite colour scheme, but it is on the whole a colour scheme mostly suited for terminals. I wouldn't consider this a flaw, as that is what it is intended for. However, it does complicate the process of designing with it. Neverglade expands upon the original colours provided by Everforest. It's other purpose is to act like the Catppuccin project, providing a centralised place for themes for various applications.
