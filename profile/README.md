<p align="center">Neverglade is an open-source low-contrast theme. It contains 3 flavours — Ebony, Oak, and Birch — each containing 22 calming colours. It is primarily designed for terminals and code editors, but can also be used to create beautiful designs (see <a href="neverglade.dev">neverglade.dev</a>)</p>



<p><i>Please note that as of current the colour scheme and all ports were created by me (<a href="https://github.com/emmalexandria">emmalexandria</a>). This took many months of work, so if you have some dollars burning a hole in your pocket, I'd highly appreciate a tip.</i></p>
